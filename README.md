# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction

## Overview
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a monetary value that represents the amount of revenue or profit a customer will give the company throughout the relationship. Understanding CLTV helps businesses identify the most profitable customers, optimize product offerings, and decide on customer acquisition budgets. This project focuses on various methodologies for calculating CLTV and demonstrates their implementation through a practical example.

## Objectives
- Identify the most profitable customers
- Optimize product offerings to maximize revenue
- Determine customer acquisition costs
- Segment customers based on profitability

## Calculating CLV
Several approaches can be employed to calculate CLV. This project explores the following methods:
- Summing profit/revenue from customers over a specific cycle
- Building a regression model with recent transaction data
- Implementing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
- Using the formula: CLV = ((Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency) / Churn Rate) x Profit Margin
